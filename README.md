# Rocks vs Mines Prediction

This project utilizes machine learning to classify objects as either rocks or mines based on various features extracted from sonar signals. The notebook in this repository demonstrates the full workflow, from data exploration to model evaluation, and provides insights into the factors influencing classification accuracy.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a model that can accurately classify objects as rocks or mines. This classification is achieved using a dataset containing sonar readings with features that help distinguish between these two categories. The model's performance is evaluated to ensure accurate and reliable predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of sonar signals that measure the strength of reflections for various frequencies. Each row in the dataset represents one object (either a rock or a mine) with numerical values corresponding to different frequencies, followed by a label indicating its class.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: Initial analysis of the dataset to understand its structure and main characteristics.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for the model.
3. **Model Training**: Using machine learning algorithms to train the model on the dataset.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the accuracy and performance of the model.
5. **Prediction**: Using the trained model to classify new data points as rocks or mines.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```


## Results

The model's accuracy and confusion matrix are provided at the end of the notebook to give insights into its performance. The analysis includes visualizations that highlight the distinguishing features between rocks and mines, further improving the interpretability of the model's predictions.
